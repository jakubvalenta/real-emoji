**Real Emoji** is a proposal for an extension of the standard emoji set with 35
new signs (words) that allow showing (talking about) our[^1] current society.

Real Emoji tries to provide many signs that are not included in the standard
emoji set, because they are controversial[^2] in certain cultures, overly
specific, too weird, too local, too personal or just forgotten. You can find the
list of the standard emoji at [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/).

## Signs

Real Emoji contains signs related to human body, life, relationships, mental
health, work, ecology, drugs, and my personal favorite meal. It follows previous
attempts (some successfull) to add new emoji to the standard set, such as the
[rifle
emoji](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/thanks-to-apples-influence-youre-not-getting-a-rifle-emoji),
[middle finger
emoji](https://gizmodo.com/how-the-middle-finger-emoji-finally-got-the-thumbs-up-1729900518),
[menstruation
emoji](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/09/period-emoji-menstruation-blood-donation),
[mosquito
emoji](https://ccp.jhu.edu/2017/09/18/creating-buzz-proposing-mosquito-emoji-public-health/),
[peach butt
emoji](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/apple-brings-back-the-peach-butt-emoji/).
[white-wine
emoji](https://slate.com/technology/2019/09/white-wine-emoji-unicode.html) or
the [pickup truck
emoji](https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/ford-secretly-created-the-new-pickup-emoji-because-nothing-is-sacred).

## Decisions

Many decisions were made while designing Real Emoji. Some of the more important
ones include not showing graphic violence or sex, chosing an unrealistic suicide
method, not connecting laziness with work, showing economic crime instead of
violent one, showing structural racism, and focusing on moralizing behavior
instead of shame.

## Use

Real Emoji are available as [Telegram stickers](/stickers/) and as a [font
file](/font/). If you wanted to use them in any app and be sure that they show
on all phones and computers, the emoji would need to be submitted to the
[Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/)[^3], an organization that
governs the universal character set, and accepted. You can [submit a
request](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html) for inclusion of Real Emoji
to the consortium yourself, if you think they meet the [selection
factors](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html#selection_factors). I
personally don't believe that they would be accepted. There is also a proposal
to [change the process how emoji are defined](https://emojiwrap.com/issues/36),
which -- if implemented -- would render the current submission process obsolete.

## Acknowledgments

The design of Real Emoji is based on [Twitter Emoji
(Twemoji)](https://twitter.github.io/twemoji/). The design of the [fetus
emoji](/emoji/fetus/) is based on a [photo by the National Museum of Health and
Medicine available at
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fetus_3_months.jpg). The design of
the [moralizing emoji](/emoji/moralizing/) is based on a [woodcut by Julius
Schnorr von Carolsfeld available at
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_102.png). The
design of the [Svíčková na smetaně emoji](/emoji/svickova/) is based on a [photo
by Matyáš Havel available at
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sv%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1#/media/File:Sv%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1_na_smetan%C4%9B.JPG). The
color of the [ugliness emoji](/emoji/ugly/) is Pantone 448C, a color [voted the
ugliest color in the
world](https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/jun/08/stylewatch-pantone-448c-ugliest-colour-world-opaque-couche-australian-smokers-fashion). The
term "hugs and kisses" is a quote from Mark Fisher's book [Capitalist
Realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism:_Is_There_No_Alternative%3F).

[^1]: from my point of view as someone who is part of the middle class, male,
    white, and lives between Prague and Berlin
[^2]: there is actually no [emoji selection
    factor](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html#selection_factors) that
    would exclude controversial emoji, however vendors (e.g. phone
    manufacturers) would most likely not implement controversial emoji, because
    they want to provide their services in all cultures; as seen with the
    [removal of the Taiwan flag
    emoji](https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-flag-emoji-disappears-iphone-hong-kong-macau-2019-10)
