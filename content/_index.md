**Real Emoji** is a proposal for an extension of the standard emoji set with 35
new signs (words) that allow showing (talking about) our[^1] contemporary
society.

Real Emoji tries to provide many signs that were not included in the standard
emoji set, because they were controversial in certain cultures, too specific,
too weird, too local, too personal or just forgotten.

Real Emoji contains signs related to human body, life, relationships ... and my
personal favourite meal.

Real Emoji are available as [Telegram stickers](/stickers) and as a [font
file](/font). If you wanted to use them in your phone or computer, they would
first need to be accepted by the [Unicode
Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/)[^2], an organization that governs the
universal character set. You can [submit a
request](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html) for inclusion of Real Emoji
to the consorcium.

The design of Real Emoji is based on [Twitter Emoji
(Twemoji)](https://twitter.github.io/twemoji/). The design of the [Svíčková na
smetaně] emoji is based on a [photo by Matyáš
Havel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sv%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1#/media/File:Sv%C3%AD%C4%8Dkov%C3%A1_na_smetan%C4%9B.JPG).
